# Binary Classification of Hotel Cancellation Using Deep Learning
## Overview
This project introduces me to classification predictions in Data Science as well as implementation of Deep Learning Models using Tensorflow and Keras Libraries in Python to predict whether the customer has cancelled the hotel booking based on a number of features
## Implementation
1. SimpleImputer and Scaling Numerical Features, SimpleImputer and OneHotEncoding Categorical Features through a Pipeline
2. Implementation of Batch Normalization, Dropout and Sigmoid & RelU Activation Layers using Keras
3. Compile model with Stochastic Gradient Descent adam optimizing function.
4. Implementation of Early Stopping to obtain best weights and reduce excessive runtime
5. Use of Classification metrics such as Accuracy (Binary), Precision, Recall, F1 Score and Confusion Matrix
