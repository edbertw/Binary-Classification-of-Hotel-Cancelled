# Binary Classification of Hotel Cancellation Using Deep Learning
## Overview
This project introduces me to classification predictions in Data Science as well as implementation of Deep Learning Models using Tensorflow and Keras Libraries in Python to predict whether the customer has cancelled the hotel booking based on a number of features
## Implementation
